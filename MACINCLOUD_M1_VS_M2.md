# M1 vs M2 for iOS App Build

## Can You Use M1? ✅ YES!

**M1 Mac Mini is perfectly fine for building your iOS app.**

## Performance Comparison

### M1 Mac Mini
- **CPU**: 8-core (4 performance + 4 efficiency cores)
- **GPU**: 8-core
- **RAM**: 16GB (same as M2)
- **Performance**: Excellent for iOS development

### M2 Mac Mini  
- **CPU**: 8-core (4 performance + 4 efficiency cores)
- **GPU**: 10-core
- **RAM**: 16GB (same as M1)
- **Performance**: Slightly faster than M1

## Real-World Impact

### Build Time Difference
- **M1**: ~15-20 minutes for a typical iOS build
- **M2**: ~12-18 minutes for a typical iOS build
- **Difference**: ~2-3 minutes (negligible for your use case)

### What M1 Can Handle
✅ Xcode 16.4 - Runs perfectly  
✅ CocoaPods installation - Works fine  
✅ Capacitor sync - No issues  
✅ iOS build and archive - Fully supported  
✅ TestFlight upload - No problem  
✅ All iOS development tools - Fully compatible  

## Cost Savings

If M1 is cheaper (which it should be), you'll save money with **zero practical impact** on your workflow.

## When to Choose M2 Instead

Only choose M2 if:
- Price difference is minimal ($0.10-0.20/hour)
- You plan to do heavy development work (multiple builds per day)
- You're doing video editing or other GPU-intensive tasks
- You want the absolute fastest build times

## Recommendation

✅ **Use M1 if it's cheaper** - You won't notice the difference for a single app build.

The M1 is still a very capable machine, and for building and uploading your iOS app to TestFlight, it's more than sufficient.

## Updated Recommended Configuration

## Bottom Line

**M1 = Perfectly fine, save money**  
**M2 = Slightly faster, but not worth extra cost for your use case**

Go with M1! 🎉
