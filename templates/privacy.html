  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This privacy policy applies to the Random AITA app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Robby Wilson (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address)</li>
    <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages</li>
    <li>The total time spent using the Application</li>
    <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

  <p>The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time with important updates, notices, or promotions.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
  <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service.</p>

  <p>The Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
  <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall process available on your device or through the app marketplace.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider will retain user data as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. If you would like your data deleted, contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:robbyaw@icloud.com">robbyaw@icloud.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The Application does not knowingly collect data from or market to children under the age of 13. If you believe your child has provided personal information, contact the Service Provider to have it removed.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. Physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards are in place to protect data.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted here, and continued use constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 21, 2025</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:robbyaw@icloud.com">robbyaw@icloud.com</a>.</p>
